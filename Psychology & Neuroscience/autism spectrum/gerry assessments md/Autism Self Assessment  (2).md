# Combined Autism-ADHD Traits Assessment

## Introduction

Many traits overlap between autism and ADHD, especially in women. This assessment focuses on recognizing traits that may indicate one or both conditions.

## Instructions

## Notes for Female Presentation

Women often show different patterns than those included in traditional diagnostic criteria:

- Special interests may be socially acceptable (psychology, animals, literature)  
- Hyperfocus may be mistaken for being "well-behaved" or "daydreaming"  
- Social difficulties may be masked by learned scripts and careful observation  
- Sensory issues may be interpreted as being "picky" or "sensitive"  
- Stimming may be more subtle (hair twirling, nail biting, jewelry fidgeting)  
- Executive function challenges might be compensated for with extensive systems
