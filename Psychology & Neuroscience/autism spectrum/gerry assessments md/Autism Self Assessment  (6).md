## Introduction

This assessment tool is designed to evaluate traits associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults. The questions reflect diagnostic criteria from current clinical standards and research. Your responses will help identify patterns that may warrant further professional evaluation.

**Instructions:** Please read each statement carefully and mark the response that best describes your experiences. Consider how you typically function in everyday life, focusing on long-term patterns rather than temporary states.

## Scoring Guide (for clinician use)

### Autism Spectrum Traits

- Section 1 (Social Communication): Score of 42+ indicates significant difficulties  
- Section 2 (Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors): Score of 42+ indicates significant patterns  
- Female-specific patterns (Section 9): Scores of 30+ may indicate significant masking

### ADHD Traits

- Section 3 (Inattention): Score of 24+ suggests clinically significant inattention  
- Section 4 (Hyperactivity/Impulsivity): Score of 24+ suggests clinically significant hyperactivity/impulsivity  
- Section 5 (Executive Functioning): Score of 24+ indicates significant executive function challenges

### Interpretation Notes

- High scores in both autism and ADHD sections suggest possible co-occurrence  
- Consider developmental history and current functional impact  
- Female presentation often involves significant masking and may differ from traditional diagnostic criteria  
- Executive function challenges often overlap between conditions

## Important Disclaimer

This assessment tool is not a diagnostic instrument and does not replace professional clinical evaluation. It is designed to identify patterns that may warrant further investigation by qualified healthcare professionals. A formal diagnosis requires comprehensive evaluation by a licensed clinician with expertise in neurodevelopmental conditions.

Autism and ADHD exist on spectrums, with traits varying widely in presentation and intensity. Many adults develop coping strategies that mask underlying challenges. This self-assessment is meant to facilitate discussion with healthcare providers and inform next steps in the diagnostic process.
