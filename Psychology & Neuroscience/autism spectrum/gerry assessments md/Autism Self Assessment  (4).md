# Special Considerations for Adult Women with Autism/ADHD

## Estrogen-Dopamine Interaction Assessment

Estrogen affects dopamine levels, which can impact ADHD symptoms throughout the menstrual cycle. Track these symptoms daily for at least one full cycle:

**Cycle Day:** \_\_\_ (Day 1 \= first day of period)

Rate severity 0-3:

- [ ] Ability to focus  
- [ ] Working memory function  
- [ ] Emotional regulation  
- [ ] Executive function  
- [ ] Motivation level  
- [ ] Energy level  
- [ ] Sensory sensitivity  
- [ ] Medication effectiveness (if applicable)

**Notes:**

- Days 1-5 (menstruation): Typically worst ADHD symptoms  
- Days 6-11 (follicular): Often improving symptoms  
- Days 12-16 (ovulation): Often best functioning  
- Days 17-28 (luteal): Gradually worsening symptoms

## Autistic Burnout Recognition Checklist

Autistic burnout often goes unrecognized in women. Check all that you've experienced:

### Past Year Experiences

- [ ] Loss of skills/abilities you previously had  
- [ ] Increased difficulty managing sensory input  
- [ ] Reduced tolerance for social interaction  
- [ ] Increased difficulty masking autistic traits  
- [ ] Extreme fatigue not relieved by rest  
- [ ] Reduced executive function  
- [ ] Increased meltdowns/shutdowns  
- [ ] Difficulty communicating/finding words  
- [ ] Increased need for sameness/routine  
- [ ] Feeling "stuck" or unable to do previously manageable tasks

### Potential Triggers

- [ ] Major life transition (job, move, relationship)  
- [ ] Extended period of masking/camouflaging  
- [ ] Accumulation of sensory stressors  
- [ ] Social demands exceeding capacity  
- [ ] Loss of support system or accommodation  
- [ ] Health issues/illness  
- [ ] Hormonal changes (perimenopause, pregnancy, etc.)  
- [ ] Extended period without adequate rest/recovery  
- [ ] Trauma or significant stress  
- [ ] Pressure to perform neurotypically

## Female-Specific Masking Assessment

Women often mask their neurodivergent traits differently than men. Rate how frequently you use these strategies: 0 \= Never 1 \= Occasionally 2 \= Frequently 3 \= Almost Always

### Social Masking

- [ ] Carefully observing and mimicking others' social behaviors  
- [ ] Preparing scripts/topics for conversations  
- [ ] Using humor or self-deprecation to hide difficulties  
- [ ] Taking on "helper" or "caretaker" roles to navigate social situations  
- [ ] Developing special interest in psychology or human behavior  
- [ ] Overcompensating with extreme politeness or people-pleasing  
- [ ] Mirroring others' communication styles and phrases  
- [ ] Developing "personas" for different social contexts

### Professional/Academic Masking

- [ ] Working significantly harder than peers to meet same standards  
- [ ] Creating extensive organizational systems to compensate for executive function  
- [ ] Taking on extra work to hide difficulties with specific tasks  
- [ ] Spending excessive time preparing for meetings/presentations  
- [ ] Developing expertise in specific areas to offset general challenges  
- [ ] Using humor to deflect from mistakes or confusion  
- [ ] Staying late or arriving early to manage workload without being observed  
- [ ] Developing reputation as "quirky" but valuable contributor

### Personal Life Masking

- [ ] Developing systems for household management that seem excessive to others  
- [ ] Limiting social engagements to prevent burnout  
- [ ] Creating socially acceptable explanations for sensory needs/preferences  
- [ ] Using physical appearance (clothing, makeup, etc.) strategically  
- [ ] Scheduling excessive alone time for recovery  
- [ ] Developing acceptable special interests (makeup, fashion, cooking, childcare)  
- [ ] Making self-deprecating jokes about sensory needs or executive function  
- [ ] Finding compatible partners who compensate for challenges

**Total Masking Score:** \_\_\_/72

**Interpretation:**

- 0-24: Minimal masking  
- 25-48: Moderate masking (common in late-diagnosed women)  
- 49-72: Significant masking (very common in undiagnosed autistic women)

## Co-occurring Conditions Screening

Women with autism/ADHD often have co-occurring conditions that complicate diagnosis. Check all that apply:

### Anxiety-Related

- [ ] Generalized anxiety  
- [ ] Social anxiety  
- [ ] Panic attacks  
- [ ] Obsessive-compulsive tendencies  
- [ ] Specific phobias

### Mood-Related

- [ ] Depression episodes  
- [ ] Mood swings  
- [ ] History of burnout periods  
- [ ] Emotional dysregulation  
- [ ] Rejection sensitive dysphoria

### Physical

- [ ] Chronic fatigue  
- [ ] Digestive issues  
- [ ] Chronic pain  
- [ ] Sleep disorders  
- [ ] Sensory processing difficulties  
- [ ] Migraine headaches  
- [ ] Coordination/balance issues

### Other

- [ ] History of eating disorders  
- [ ] Perfectionism  
- [ ] People-pleasing tendencies  
- [ ] Difficulty with interoception (sensing bodily states)  
- [ ] History of misdiagnosis  
- [ ] Trauma responses  
- [ ] Identity exploration/uncertainty

**Note:** Many women receive diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or personality disorders before their autism or ADHD is recognized.
