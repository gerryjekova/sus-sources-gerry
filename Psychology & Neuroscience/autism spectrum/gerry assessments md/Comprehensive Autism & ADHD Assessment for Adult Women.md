## Scoring & Interpretation \-

**Total your scores for each section:**

- Social Communication & Interaction (Section 1): 45/72  
- Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors (Section 2): 56/72  
- Executive Function/ADHD (Section 3): 43/72  
- Female-Specific Manifestations (Section 4): 51/72  
- Co-occurring Features (Section 5): 35/48

**Interpretation Guide:**

- Scores of 70% or higher in Sections 1 and 2 suggest significant autistic traits  
- Scores of 70% or higher in Section 3 suggest significant ADHD traits  
- Sections 4 and 5 provide context on how these conditions may present specifically in women

**Important Notes:**

1. This assessment is a screening tool, not a formal diagnosis  
2. Female autism often presents differently than the traditional male-based diagnostic criteria  
3. Autism and ADHD frequently co-occur, with overlapping symptoms  
4. Professional evaluation is recommended if scores are elevated  
5. Consider how these traits impact daily functioning when determining need for diagnosis/support

## Additional Considerations

### Strengths Often Associated with Autism/ADHD in Women

- [x] Intense focus and persistence on topics of interest   
- [x] Pattern recognition and attention to detail  
- [x] Creative thinking and unique problem-solving approaches  
- [x] Strong sense of justice and moral reasoning  
- [x] Authenticity and straightforwardness  
- [x] Deep empathy (though sometimes expressed differently)  
- [x] Observational skills and analytical thinking

### Common Masking Strategies in Women

- Mimicking others' social behaviors and expressions  
- [x] Preparing scripts for anticipated interactions  
- [x] Suppressing stimming behaviors in public  
- [x] Developing explanations for accommodations needed  
- Practicing appropriate facial expressions  
- Extensive research on social expectations  
- Exhausting efforts to appear "normal"

### Impact of Hormonal Fluctuations

- [x] Symptoms may fluctuate with menstrual cycle  
- [x] Sensory sensitivities often increase during hormonal shifts  
- Executive function may worsen premenstrually  
- [x] Emotional regulation challenges may intensify during hormonal changes  
- [x] Masking abilities may decrease during periods of hormonal fluctuation

This assessment was designed specifically for adult women who may have developed compensatory strategies that mask traditional autism/ADHD presentations. A professional evaluation should incorporate developmental history, current functioning across multiple contexts, and the impact of these traits on quality of life.
