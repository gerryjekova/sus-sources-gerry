## Scoring & Interpretation \-

Total your scores for each section:

- Social Communication & Interaction (Section 1): 45/72  
- Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors (Section 2): 56/72  
- Executive Function/ADHD (Section 3): 43/72  
- Female-Specific Manifestations (Section 4): 51/72  
- Co-occurring Features (Section 5): 35/48

Interpretation Guide:

- Scores of 70% or higher in Sections 1 and 2 suggest significant autistic traits  
- Scores of 70% or higher in Section 3 suggest significant ADHD traits  
- Sections 4 and 5 provide context on how these conditions may present specifically in women

Important Notes:

1. This assessment is a screening tool, not a formal diagnosis  
2. Female autism often presents differently than the traditional male-based diagnostic criteria  
3. Autism and ADHD frequently co-occur, with overlapping symptoms  
4. Professional evaluation is recommended if scores are elevated  
5. Consider how these traits impact daily functioning when determining need for diagnosis/support

## Additional Considerations

### Strengths Often Associated with Autism/ADHD in Women

- \[ x \] Intense focus and persistence on topics of interest  
- \[ x \] Pattern recognition and attention to detail  
- \[ x \] Creative thinking and unique problem-solving approaches  
- \[ x \] Strong sense of justice and moral reasoning  
- \[ x \] Authenticity and straightforwardness  
- \[ x \] Deep empathy (though sometimes expressed differently)  
- \[ x \] Observational skills and analytical thinking

### Common Masking Strategies in Women

- Mimicking others' social behaviors and expressions  
- \[ x \] Preparing scripts for anticipated interactions  
- \[ x \] Suppressing stimming behaviors in public  
- \[ x \] Developing explanations for accommodations needed  
- Practicing appropriate facial expressions  
- Extensive research on social expectations  
- Exhausting efforts to appear "normal"

### Impact of Hormonal Fluctuations

- \[ x \] Symptoms may fluctuate with menstrual cycle  
- \[ x \] Sensory sensitivities often increase during hormonal shifts  
- Executive function may worsen premenstrually  
- \[ x \] Emotional regulation challenges may intensify during hormonal changes  
- \[ x \] Masking abilities may decrease during periods of hormonal fluctuation

This assessment was designed specifically for adult women who may have developed compensatory strategies that mask traditional autism/ADHD presentations. A professional evaluation should incorporate developmental history, current functioning across multiple contexts, and the impact of these traits on quality of life.

# Special Considerations for Adult Women with Autism/ADHD

## Estrogen-Dopamine Interaction Assessment \- 15.5

Estrogen affects dopamine levels, which can impact ADHD symptoms throughout the menstrual cycle. Track these symptoms daily for at least one full cycle:

Cycle Day: \_\_\_ (Day 1 \= first day of period)

Rate severity 0-3:

- [x] Ability to focus \- 2  
- [x] Working memory function \- 2  
- [x] Emotional regulation \- 1.5  
- [x] Executive function \- 1.5  
- [x] Motivation level \- 3  
- [x] Energy level \- 2.5  
- [x] Sensory sensitivity \- 2  
- [x] Medication effectiveness (if applicable) \- 1

Notes:

- Days 1-5 (menstruation): Typically worst ADHD symptoms \- NO. Only mood regulation. No ADHD symptoms intensify other than the H   
- Days 6-11 (follicular): Often improving symptoms \- Yea it goes away, but leftover bad mood  
- Days 12-16 (ovulation): Often best functioning \- Nope. It can be decent / stagnant / depressing of a period  
- Days 17-28 (luteal): Gradually building up the energy and steam and preparing for a rebirth and reset.

- Social difficulties may be masked by learned scripts and careful observation \- yes :D very good at it when I want to perform

- Stimming may be more subtle (hair twirling, nail biting, jewelry fidgeting) \- YES :D   
- Executive function challenges might be compensated for with extensive systems \- YES YES YES YES YES YEEEEEEEEEEEEES\! :D
